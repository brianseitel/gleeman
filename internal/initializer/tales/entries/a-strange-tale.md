I've been thinking a lot about the Wheel of Time lately. What is it about this series that grabs me? I've spent hours and hours thinking about it, and what I keep coming back to is this idea that the world in the books feels _lived in_. It's not just epic. It's not just grand. But it feels real.

The Two Rivers _feels_ like a town with real history. The bickering between the Village Council and the Women's Circle is so fully and totally believable that I can imagine myself in the middle of it all. The fearmongering of Cenn Buie, the brashness and obnoxiousness of the Coplins and the Congars, the disdain the older Council and Circle have for the younger Wisdom al'Meara,... with just a few words, Jordan created a town that feels more real that some towns I've actually visited!

Not to mention the machinations in the White Tower or the "no one can walk masked in the city" rule in the Borderlands. The way Jordan describes the crowds of Baerlon and the streets of Caemlyn don't just feel larger than life, they feel _real_ too. I can picture grime and dust in places Jordan never mentioned. I can smell the musk of the townsfolk as they clamor together to watch Logain pass by.
